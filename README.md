# Jericho

Inspired from the Jericho Missile in the movie Iron Man (2008), Jericho sends events to all the integrated analytics tools.
Jericho makes adding(removing) new analytics tools to your existing projects a lot easier.

## Usage

Map<String, Object> attributesMap;
Map<String, Object> userPropertiesMap;

// setting user properties
jericho.setUserProperties(userPropertiesMap);
